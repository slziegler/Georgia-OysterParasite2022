## Title: Universally high microparasite prevalence in an ecosystem engineer across a large spatial scale


**Authors:** Shelby L. Ziegler, Wil E. Atencio, John M. Carroll and James E. Byers 

**Abstract:** Spatial variation in parasitic infection may have many physical and biological drivers. Uncovering these drivers may be especially important for parasites of ecosystem engineers because the engineers are foundational to their communities. Oysters are an important coastal ecosystem engineer that have declined drastically worldwide, in part due to enhanced cases of the lethal oyster diseases, Dermo and MSX, caused by the protozoan parasites Perkinsus marinus and Haplosporidium nelsoni, respectively. Besides water quality and tidal exposure, there is little information on how other variables, such as landscape factors and biotic interactions influence the prevalence and intensity of these pathogens and the incidence of co-infection in oysters across a large spatial scale. To examine drivers of spatial variation in these oyster parasites, we sampled 24 reefs systematically spread along the 150km coast of Georgia, USA. We found universally high prevalence of oysters with at least one of these parasites across all sites (91.02 ± 8.89, Mean ± SD). Oyster size, temperature, and salinity, as well as biological variables and landscape factors were significantly related to oyster parasites. However, even our strongest statistical models only explained one third of the variation in parasite patterns. Not only are high levels of parasite prevalence potentially problematic for a pivotal ecosystem engineer, but the parasites’ low variability limits the explanatory power of any independent variables. Our findings suggest that even larger, regional scale data may be needed to detect environmental drivers when parasites are homogenous.
